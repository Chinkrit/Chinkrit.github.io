### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite lab because I learn how to write a code that solve a mathematical problems, in this case we wrote a code about finding the average. This sparks a lot of interest for me because if we can write codes that can solve math questions for us, is it possible for us to write codes that can solve harder mathematical expressions. This is why this lab was one of my favorite labs that I had done.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9, part 2 was also one of my favorite lab to do because I learn how to write a code that can check if the two philopsher have the same schedule, if they do then the schedule is invalid and if they don't then the schedule is valid. Learning how to write codes that do stuff like this can be super useful for other matters. This is why I really enjoyed writing this code.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, Part 2 was one of my favorite code to write because it was really challenging. I had to learn how to perservere and really be methodical. I had to write a code so that it prints that the population of a city is some number. It was really hard to get it to print that because of all the files that I had to put code in and the list of counties and population was really long. When I did manage to successfully write it, it was very rewarding, and I was so proud of myself. That is why lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorite lab.
